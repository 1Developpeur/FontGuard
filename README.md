# Google Fonts Privacy Proxy

A Cloudflare Worker that acts as a privacy-focused proxy for Google Fonts, allowing you to serve Google Fonts from your own domain without exposing user data to Google's servers.

## üîí Privacy Benefits

- **No IP tracking**: User requests never reach Google's servers directly
- **No referrer leakage**: Your website visitors browsing data stays private

## üöÄ Features

- Proxies Google Fonts CSS API (`fonts.googleapis.com/css2`)
- Proxies Google Fonts static files (`fonts.gstatic.com`)
- Automatic URL rewriting in CSS files
- Removes tracking headers and privacy-invasive headers
- Aggressive caching for optimal performance
- Health check endpoint

## üìã Prerequisites

- Cloudflare account (free tier works)
- Custom domain or Cloudflare Workers subdomain
- Basic knowledge of Cloudflare Workers

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Method 1: Cloudflare Dashboard

1. Log in to your [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/)
2. Go to **Workers & Pages** ‚Üí **Create application** ‚Üí **Create Worker**
3. Replace the default code with the contents of `worker.js`
4. Click **Save and Deploy**
5. Optionally, set up a custom domain in the **Triggers** tab

### Method 2: Wrangler CLI (not tested)   

1. Install Wrangler CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g wrangler
   ```

2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/1Developpeur/FontGuard
   cd FontGuard
   ```

3. Login to Cloudflare:
   ```bash
   wrangler login
   ```

4. Deploy the worker:
   ```bash
   wrangler deploy
   ```

## üìñ Usage

### Basic Usage

Replace your Google Fonts URLs, only domain changes:

**Before:**
```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;500;600&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```

**After:**
```html
<link href="https://your-worker-domain.workers.dev/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;500;600&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```

### Health Check

Check if your worker is running:
```bash
curl https://your-worker-domain.workers.dev/health
```

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

You can customize the worker behavior by modifying the code:

- **Cache TTL**: Adjust `cacheTtl` values for different caching strategies
- **CORS**: Modify `access-control-allow-origin` header as needed
- **Headers**: Add or remove headers from the `headersToRemove` array

### Wrangler Configuration

Create a `wrangler.toml` file for advanced configuration:

```toml
name = "google-fonts-proxy"
main = "worker.js"
compatibility_date = "2024-01-01"

[env.production]
route = "fonts.yourdomain.com/*"
```
